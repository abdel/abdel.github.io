I am **Abdelrahman Ahmed**, a software engineer and AI researcher based in Sydney, Australia. I work predominantly with Python, JavaScript, Node.js and React. I also dabble with other things, including Go, PHP, C/C++, and Java.

I completed a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of Technology Sydney, with a major in Enterprise Systems Development and Data Analytics. I am interested in artifical general intelligence, deep learning, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems and privacy.

Feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abdel_m) or contact me at abdel@abdel.me if you have any questions. I'm also frequently on IRC/Freenode as **abdel**.
