I am **Abdelrahman Ahmed**, a full-stack developer, student and occasional freelancer based in Sydney,
Australia. I work predominantly with JavaScript, Node.js and React. I also dabble with other things, including Python, PHP, C/C++, and Java.

I am currently completing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of Technology Sydney, majoring in
Enterprise Systems Development and sub-majoring in Data Analytics. I am interested in deep learning,
reinforcement learning, autonomous driving and privacy.

Feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abdel_m) or contact me at abdel@abdel.me if you have any questions. I'm also frequently on IRC/Freenode as **abdel**.
