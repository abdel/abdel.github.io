I have been using Hugo for a while now, but the publishing process and the deployment setup with S3 was a bit too complicated that I just ended up not really posting anything. I decided to move everything over to Jekyll and simply use GitHub Pages in order to simplify things.

In other news, I'm currently in my last semester of my Bachelor's degree at UTS. I've also recently joined the team at [Project AGI](https://agi.io/) to work on artifical general intelligence, so may be posting more about that in the near future but in the mean time check out our blog for interesting articles.

As part of one the subjects I'm doing this term, I'll be developing an immutable professional journal application using Xamarin, C# and Azure with a group. It will be a cross-platform application using Xamarin.Forms, likely only iOS and Android though. I'll be open-sourcing the code on GitHub after marking, etc.

I have also been spending time getting into reinforcement learning
